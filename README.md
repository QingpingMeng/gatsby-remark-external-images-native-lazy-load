## What is the different between this plugin and `gatsby-remark-images`?

`gatsby-remark-images` also has the support to add `loading` attribute, but it only works for local images, not images from external sources.

## What is all albout `loading` attribute for img tag?

```html 
<img src="image.png" loading="lazy" alt="â€¦">
```

This image will be **NOT** loaded over network until the viewport is approaching the it.

This will significantly speed up your site loading if there are tons of images. 

Here are the supported values for the `loading` attribute:
* `auto`: Default lazy-loading behavior of the browser, which is the same as not including the attribute.
* `lazy`: Defer loading of the resource until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport.
* `eager`: Load the resource immediately, regardless of where it's located on the page.

## What browrser are supporting this `loading` attribute?

It is already suppported in Chrome 76 and later versions. It should be supported in any Chromium 76-based browser. 

If browser doesn't support this attribute, it will be ignored and images will load as usual.
